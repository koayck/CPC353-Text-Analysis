3194,Machine Learning, Machine Learning Using R Instructor,"Machine Learning Using R – Los Angeles, CA Overview The Department of Digital Technology offers a wide variety of certificate programs and courses including post-baccalaureate credit-bearing (400-level), continuing education (CEU) credit, and non-credit bearing general interest courses. Course disciplines cybersecurity, data science and applications programming subject areas. UCLA Extension courses and certificate programs offer students the opportunity to learn from highly qualified practitioners who hold advanced degrees and are passionate about teaching and can impart knowledge within their field of expertise. Applications to teach are accepted throughout the year in order to fill immediate program needs and to increase the depth of the instructor pool. Current Job Posting The current opening is for our Machine Learning Using R course. Qualified applicants possessing current knowledge and teaching experience in this area are encouraged to apply (teaching experience is not required). Course Description: This course focuses on machine learning, which is concerned with algorithms that transform information into actionable intelligence. This field is made possible due to the rapid and simultaneous evolution of available data, statistical methods and computing power. The machine learning language, R, is a cross-platform, zero-cost statistical programming environment, which offers a powerful but easy-to-learn set of tools that can assist students with finding data insights. Students learn the origins and practical applications of machine learning, how knowledge is defined and represented by computers, and the basic concepts that differentiate machine learning approaches. Machine learning algorithms can be divided into two main groups: supervised learners that are used to construct predictive models, and unsupervised learners that are used to build descriptive models. Students learn the classification, numeric predictor, pattern detection and clustering algorithms. Students learn to train a model, evaluate its performance, and improve its performance. Algorithm uses are illustrated with real-world cases, such as breast cancer diagnosis, spam filtering, identifying bank loan risk, predicting medical expenses, estimating wine quality, identifying groceries frequently purchased together, and finding teen market segments.

3416,Machine Learning,Machine Learning Research Scientist,"We live in a moment of remarkable change and opportunity that is cognitive computing. The convergence of data and technology is transforming industries, society and the workplace. CognitiveScale is looking for talent to drive market success by building cognitive business solutions. Our team integrates ML and NLP expertise with enterprise software to deliver innovative ML/AI solutions. This position is specifically for experts in the areas of data science, machine learning and statistics. We work in a dynamic environment where, depending on the complexity of the problem, we either use ML and NLP libraries from the public domain in a very heterogeneous set of platforms including Python, C/C++, and Scala, or design our own algorithms, adding to our core capabilities. These ML and NLP algorithms can require special attention to scale, careful utilization of data sparsity to promote faster execution, and deployment to cloud instances. Our task is to manage this complexity with quality engineering. Required Qualifications Stellar background in statistical machine learning and data mining, in areas including but not limited to: online learning, nonlinear optimization, high-dimensional data clustering, classification, regression, ranking, probabilistic graphical models, and deep learning. PhD degree in AI, ML, statistical NLP or related technical fields. 10+ years of hands-on experience working in data science and/or machine learning. Practical experience building, testing and deploying ML models at scale. Experience with one or more of the programming languages and machine learning tools (Python, R, Julia, C/C++, Scala). Strong publication history in top-tier journals and conferences (e.g., Machine Learning Journal, DMKD, KAIS, ICML, KDD, ACL, NIPS, ECML, NAACL, IJCAI, AAAI). Strong interpersonal and communication skills and must be able to explain technical concepts and analysis implications clearly to a wide audience, including senior executives, and be able to translate business objectives into action. Experience with deep learning tools and packages (Caffe, PyTorch, Tensorflow). A clear passion for learning emerging technologies independently and continuously. Preferred Qualifications Familiarity with models like LSTM, CNN, GCN, attention mechanism, GAN, VAE Experience with distributed training of deep models In-depth knowledge of probabilistic modeling and inference. Familiarity with models like Bayesian networks, undirected graphical models, implicit generative models and techniques like variational inference, MCMC sampling, large scale variational inference, stochastic gradient MCMC techniques is preferred. Knowledge of techniques like linear programming, convex optimization, cutting plane methods, momentum methods, stochastic gradient descent, alternating direction method of multipliers. In-depth knowledge of scalable inference in both directed and undirected graphical models should be very useful, given our heavy use of probabilistic graphical models to handle sparse, multi-relational and temporal data with complex interactions. Considerations We understand that you cannot be an expert in everything. Furthermore, the technologies we are using today are by no means a static set. Given the required qualifications, we are looking for candidates who are driven and curious. Search Firm Representatives Please Read Carefully: CognitiveScale is not accepting unsolicited assistance from search firms for this employment opportunity. Please: no phone calls or emails. All resumes submitted by search firms to any employee at CognitiveScale via email, the Internet or in any form and/or method without a valid written search agreement in place for this position will be deemed the sole property of CognitiveScale.

How do we quantify fundamental tradeoffs between various aspects of the quality of experience (e.g., video quality, time spent waiting for video to load)? How can we objectively classify viewing experiences as “high quality” vs. “low quality”? Which network and device characteristics are predictive of high- versus low-quality experiences? What are key indicators for device health and performance? How can we automatically detect problematic or anomalous new devices or changes to existing devices? Work on these problems has drawn from several areas including statistical signal processing, clustering, reinforcement learning, neural networks, decision trees, and optimization. Responsibilities Develop new statistical models / machine learning techniques for optimizing streaming quality in our product.
